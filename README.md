Soooooooo you're here to listen about a story? Okey, I travel about this world so I will tell you one of my travel. <br> 
It was a sunny day and I walked around **the dwarf's town of Wisdom.** I was thinking about what I wanted to eat, when I suddenly heard a scream. I took my sword and go to help **_asap_** It was a dwarf who were drowning. ! [(https://rappel.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_1082-1080x675.jpg)] <br>
As soon as I realized he needed my help, I rushed to him and reached out my hand. Fortunately, he was able to grab it and squeeze it as hard as he could. Once he was out of the water, we went to a quiet, dry place where he sat for a second. <br>
