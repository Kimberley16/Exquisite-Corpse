# here my story
Soooooooo you're here to listen about a story? Okey, I travel about this world so I will tell you one of my travel. It was a sunny day and I walked around **the dwarf's town of Wisdom.** I was thinking about what I wanted to eat, when I suddenly heard a scream. I took my sword and go to help **_asap_** It was a dwarf who were drowning. ! [(https://rappel.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_1082-1080x675.jpg)]
The dwarf was splashing around, making a lot of noise ! 
However, since it was only a Dwarf, I turned around and walked away. 
That dwarf was never heard of again.
However, just as I was walking away I heard another scream.
This time it was a giant !
He was huuuuuuuge.
